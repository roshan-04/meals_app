# meals_app

A new Flutter project.

/*
//A riverpod is a state management tool developed by a team that developed provider.
//riverpod is used by creating a provider which is an object created based on a class that is provided by the riverpod package
//This provider then can provide a potentially dynamic value
and can also provide methods that may change that value in the end and
then you can set in any widget a consumer that is connected to the provider and it will be
connected automatically by riverpod package and in that consumer widget, you can then listen to changes
through that provider value or even trigger those changes by calling those methods that might be provided by the provider
//We have a central provider and any widget can set up a consumer, you dont need to pass these cross state management values
//between those widget, instead every widget can directly connect to provider.
